Transforms code to return a quoted version its macroexpansion
using the host lisp to implicitly augment the lexical environment.
Expands macros, macrolets, symbol-macros, symbol-macrolets, and
compiler-macros.  Removes macrolets and symbol-macrolets.

Supports a few non-standard special forms for current (2009) Lisps.

Lightly tested on SBCL 1.0.29, ClozureCL 1.4-pre, Lispworks 5.1,
Allegro 8.1


- 20100301 do not totally discard macrolet bodies (doh), as 
  reported by mathrick on #lisp

- 20100701 correct the mistaken loop bindings to remove warnings for CCL. 
  reported by Daniel Gackle

- 20130512 fixed a bug caused by nested macrolets and the timing of
  the evaluation. Added a few test
  cases which passes in the new version and not in the older version.
  Tested on sbcl 1.1.6.15
